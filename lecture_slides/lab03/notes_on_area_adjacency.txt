# Constraints on the states/ranges in BioGeoBEARS
#######################################################

1. Adjacency to allow different ranges:

By default, every combination of areas is allowed to make ranges

If areas: A, B, C

Then, the ranges (/states) are: null, A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, ABC
(8 ranges or states)

Now, pretend that areas A and C are not touching, and 
pretend that we want to declare that areas must be touching
for a species to occupy both of them. In that case, we could
manually reduced the list of ranges/states to exclude
range "AC".

New ranges list: null, A, B, C, AB, BC, ABC (7 ranges/states)

2. Area absence to control the state space

Let's say area B disappears between 5-10 Ma

ranges_lists: 
0-5 Ma: null, A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, ABC
5-10 Ma: null, A, C, AC
10+ Ma: null, A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, ABC


3. Control the state space by reducing max_range_size



4. All of the above are different from controlling the
*dispersal rates* based on distance or connectivity
